About a Fractal

The list of fractals can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension

Very important to mention The Rosetta code:
https://rosettacode.org where I found the awesome
coloring function of the Julia Set

Instructions:
	-Select any fractal and click send
	-A hint on the input range will be displayed
	-Click send and watch while its done
	-Use the stop button to halt the execution at any time
	-Tree, IFS-Dragon, Barnsley Fern, Julia Set, Kosh and Moore:
		*Accept additional input
		*The SEND button is disabled in favor of the new DONE/PLAY
		*To change fractal click STOP first
		*In the IFS use the CLEAR button to clear the canvas when playing with the angles
